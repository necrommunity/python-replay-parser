# Replay Parser

A replay parser for Necrodancer: AMPLIFIED, which will store all replays into a database for viewing later.

## Building Config File

Copy the `config_template.ini` as `config.ini`. Update any of the defaults if your replay folder doesn't exist there. If you aren't sure, remove the `REPLAY_FOLDER` value, so it reads as `REPLAY_FOLDER=`. The script will ask you to find the folder and then save it to the config file.
